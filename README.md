# Machine learning from scratch
Implementing different machine learning and optimization algorithms from scratch and visualizing them without any machine learning/optimization library.

## Implemented machine learning algorithms
- [x] Perceptron
- [x] Linear regression
- [x] Logistic regression
- [x] Polynomial regression
- [x] Multiclass classification (*One-vs-rest, One-vs-one*)
- [x] Nonlinear transformation

## Implemented optimization algorithms
### Unconstrained optimization :
- [x] Gradient descent
- [x] Newton
- [x] Line search (*Bisection, Newton raphson, False position*)
- [x] Backtracking line search (*Armijo, Goldstein, Weak-Wolfe, Strong-Wolfe*)

### Constrained optimization :
